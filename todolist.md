## Backend
- probe config - just a file with uuid?
- config probe - server
  - say hello
  - check if adopted
  - if yes, start sending and accepting packets
  - if no, display for adoption and ignore packets on the server side
  - store configuration on server
  - pull configuration
  - allow stopping the probe and pulling config again
- pinger on both sides
- encryption - rustls https://www.slingacademy.com/article/implementing-tls-ssl-in-rust-with-native-tls-or-rustls/, https://github.com/rustls/tokio-rustls
  - config
  - data
- transmit cancellation
- packet storage
  - use `HashMap<probe_uuid, HashMap<(device_mac, device_ip), HashSet<Packet>>>`
  - when a new packet comes in, pass it to a bounded channel
  - the receiving function will be storing packets in the db.
  - during lookup bring probes and devices to the hashmap, query db for packets if missing
## Web
- access control (modules - allow loading auth function - traits)
  - 3 nullable fields any of them should suffice
    - ip network client comes from
    - password client should send
    - regex over AP hostname - get from radius active sessions
- web UI
- OIDC
